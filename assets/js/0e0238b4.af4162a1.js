Verification of sustainability claims therefore involves assessing a bundle of linked credentials (aka a \"transparency graph\") drawn from all or part of a value chain.

For example, a conformity assessment body that is accredited to test strength of structured steel might not be accredited to issue emissions intensity certificates. A technically valid emissions certificate linked to a technically valid accreditation certificate that has a different scope would be fraudulent.
