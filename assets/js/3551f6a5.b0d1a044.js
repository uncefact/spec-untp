Under the framework, independent third parties (certifiers) assess products against recognised standards and issue conformity certificates. Furthermore, a global network of mutually recognised national accreditation authorities assess the certifiers to ensure that the conformity certificates are issued by suitably qualified organisations. For example, a manufacturer may claim that their product meets a particular environmental standard. You might ask "how do I know that claim is true?" and the answer would be "because a third party tested the product and issued a certificate". You might then ask "yes, but how do I know that the third party can be trusted?" and the answer would be "because they have been accredited by the national accreditation authority". Despite all this, it\'s still a relatively simple process to create realistic looking but fake paper certificates.

UNTP does not demand that every product claim is third-party assessed, nor that every third party certifier is formally accredited, but does make that chain of trust visible where it exists.
