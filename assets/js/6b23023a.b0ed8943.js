However, using a URL itself as the identifier brings some issues of its own. For example, over the medium to long term, many URLs suffer 'link rot' - that is, the URL no longer functions. Or if it does, it may lead to a Web page very different from the one originally intended. Furthermore, existing data exchange systems are likely to be built on short offline identifiers.
