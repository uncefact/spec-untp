## [Extensions Methodology](ExtensionsMethodology.md)

UNTP is designed as a common core that is usable by any industry sector or in any regulatory jurisdiction. This extensions methodology describes how to extend UNTP to meet the specific needs of any industry sector or regulated market in such a way that the extension maintains core interoperability with any other extension.  This cross-industry and cross-border interoperability is a core value of UNTP because almost every value chain will cross industry and/or national borders.

Anyone can take UNTP and extend it for any purpose. But for the extension to be registered as UNTP conformant, an extension MUST remain interoperable with UNTP. This is achieved by following the governance, methodology, and testing processes described on the [Extensions Methodology Page](ExtensionsMethodology.md)


## [Extensions Register](ExtensionsRegister.md)

The UNTP project maitnains a list of registered [industry and/or geography specific extensions](ExtensionsRegister.md).  

In some cases, UNTP extensions are themselves UN projects - such as the extensions defined by the [UN critical raw materials traceability and transparency project](https://uncefact.github.io/project-crm/). In most cases however, industry sectors and/or national projects will govern their own extensions.
