## For Buyers and Suppliers in the Value Chain

Implementation guidance is broken into three phases (crawl, walk, run) that provide a mechanism to safely transition from low cost pilots to full scale production implementations with decision points (proceed, pivot, pause) at each stage gate.

| Phase             | Focus                                                                                     | Outcome                                                                                                                                              | Dependency                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discovery (crawl) | Familiarisation with UNTP. Assessment of scope and value.                                 | Manually created trial digital credentials exchanged with a small number of trading partners. Business case for Alpha phase ready for decision.      | None                                                                                          |
| Alpha (walk)      | Validation of integration cost & complexity. Validation of scope and value                | Automated creation and verification of digital credentials from natural business systems (test environments). Ready to scale. Go/NoGo decision ready | [Community Activation Program](../business-case/CommunityActivationProgram.md) has commenced. |
| Beta (run)        | Managed expansion to full scale implementation for all products, facilities, and partners | Realisation and reporting of ongoing value                                                                                                           | Successful testing and trial using production systems                                         |
