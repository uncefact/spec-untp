## 2025-02-20 Meeting Summary

**Facilitator:** Steve (Speaker 1)  
**Attendees:** Stefano, Danique, Suzanne, Virginia, Proc, Nis, Zach, Michael, Bart, Alex, Nick, David, and others.

#### **Key Discussion Points:**

1. **UN-Sponsored Pilots and Governance of Extensions (Steve, Stefano)**
   - Steve shared updates on the UN-sponsored pilots on textiles and critical minerals, discussing whether they should have separate definitions or be grouped globally.
   - Stefano emphasized the importance of the 80-20 approach for UNTP extensions.
   - Discussion on governance and whether international bodies exist for specific minerals.

2. **Public Review of Recommendation 49 (Suzanne, Steve, Virginia)**
   - Suzanne provided an update on Recommendation 49, which is about to go for public review.
   - The review will be structured to minimize incoming changes before final approval.
   - Virginia clarified that REC 49’s review is distinct from the public review of UNTP, and it is important to ensure it is approved in July without unnecessary complications.

3. **Concerns on UNTP Specification Readiness (Steve, Nis, Alex)**
   - Steve raised the question of whether the UNTP specification pages are sufficiently developed for public review.
   - Nis suggested limiting the scope of what is reviewed, keeping only mature and essential parts.
   - Alex proposed a more structured approach to incomplete sections by using placeholders instead of “TBC” labels.

4. **Feedback on UNTP Documentation & Usability (Danique, Nis, Michael, Zach)**
   - **Danique’s Review Findings:**
     - **Overload of information:** Fragmented resources, lack of clear examples.
     - **Navigation Issues:** Users find it hard to access the right content.
     - **Need for Role-Specific Guidance:** Different audiences require tailored documentation.
     - **Business Case Clarity:** Implementers need to understand the practical value.
   - **Recommendations:**
     - Consolidate resources, improve navigation, enhance onboarding with examples.
     - Use progressive disclosure to present information in digestible steps.

5. **Simplifying UNTP and Restructuring Specs (Nis, Steve, Zach, Bart)**
   - Nis proposed removing unnecessary complexity from specifications, particularly in role-based access control.
   - Steve agreed that UNTP should focus on essential functionalities and possibly split off components that are more general-purpose.
   - Bart highlighted the challenge of transitioning from paper-based supply chains to digital ones and called for a phased approach.

6. **Global Trust Register & Future Pilots (Steve)**
   - The Global Trust Register, involving the Spanish Business Register and Australian Livestock Identification Scheme, will conduct pilots to refine identity-related UNTP components.
   - There’s a need to balance current spec development with learnings from these pilots.

7. **Action Items & Next Steps:**

## 2024-08-15 Meeting Summary

**Date**: August 14, 2024  
**Attendees**:  
- **Steve** (Speaker 1)  
- **Phil** (Speaker 2)  
- **Virginia** (Speaker 4)  
- **Zach** (Speaker 5)  
- **Patrick** (Speaker 3)  
- **Harley** (Speaker 13)  
- **Todd Taylor** (Speaker 7)  
- **Bree** (Speaker 8)

**Key Discussion Points**:

1. **Pull Request Review (Phil's Updates)**:
   - Phil discussed the simplification of terminology in the pull request. His changes primarily involved correcting typos and substituting GS1 references with corresponding ISO/IEC standards for event tracking and business vocabularies. This was done to align politically and avoid implying that GS1 identifiers are mandatory for using EPCIS.
   - Steve and others approved the pull request, agreeing to merge it as it was a simple update.

2. **ISO and UN Involvement in Global Digital Passport Standards**:
   - Steve mentioned an upcoming meeting at ISO to review a candidate project proposed by a Chinese standards authority to develop a global digital passport standard. He was invited to co-chair this initiative, potentially representing both the UN and ISO. The group discussed the significance of this project and the potential implications of having a UN co-chair involved.
   - Phil provided additional context, mentioning the Vienna Memorandum, an agreement between ISO and CEN-CENELEC to avoid duplication of efforts in standard development. He also noted GS1’s interest in participating in the project.

3. **New Digital Facility Record Proposal**:
   - Steve introduced the idea of adding a new credential type, a **Digital Facility Record (DFR)**, to the UN Transparency Protocol (UNTP). This record would focus on the facility itself rather than the product and could be used to track sustainability assessments at the facility level.
   - Virginia and Phil supported the idea, with Virginia suggesting the term "Facility Profile" to better represent the data. The group discussed how this could streamline sustainability reporting by making facilities first-order objects rather than secondary attributes of products.

4. **Challenges with Product Passport Updates**:
   - Zach raised concerns about updating digital product passports (DPPs) after they have been issued, such as adding post-sale repair events or certifications. The group acknowledged that while updates are crucial, there are challenges with ensuring that only authorized entities can modify the passport.
   - Steve proposed the idea of allowing certain events to be added to a product passport by authorized third parties, like certified repairers or recycling plants, using a delegated authority model.

5. **Formation of a Working Group**:
   - A new working group was formed, led by Zach, to explore solutions for managing updates to digital product passports. The group will work on defining the conditions under which updates can be made and will consider different approaches to identity resolution and authorization.

6. **Conformity Assessment Scheme Clarification**:
   - Bree raised a question regarding the linkage between conformity assessment schemes and regulations within the digital product passport framework. Steve clarified that in the context of product conformity, an assessment can reference multiple standards or regulations, bundled together in a scheme.
   - The group discussed how this framework might need to be adapted for regulatory permits and other credentials outside of product conformity.

**Action Items**:
- **Phil** and **Zach** to collaborate on a working group to explore digital product passport updates.
- **Steve** to create a proposal for the Digital Facility Record and present it for further review.
- **Bree** and **Patrick** to revisit the mapping of assessment schemes to regulations for conformity credentials and report back on potential updates to the framework.

**Conclusion**:
The meeting focused on refining standards around digital product passports, facility records, and conformity assessment schemes. The formation of a working group will drive further exploration of issues related to product passport updates and maintaining data integrity across complex supply chains.
