## 2025-03-06 Meeting Summary

**Chair:** Steve  
**Attendees:** Nick, Zach, Alberto Spritorius, Ali Bezirizadeh, Peter, Patrick, Danika, Ashley, Adrian, Albertus, and other contributors  

#### **1. Welcome and Introductions**  
- **Steve** welcomed attendees and acknowledged voluntary participation.  
- **Alberto Spritorius** (Tuneas International) introduced himself, explaining his background in vehicle license plate manufacturing and standards.  
- **Ali Bezirizadeh** (AI Simpro, Canada) introduced his work on bulk material traceability in the mining sector.  

#### **2. GS1 Commitment to UNTP**  
- **Steve** announced GS1’s commitment to implementing the UNTP Identity Resolver (IDR).  
- **Peter** confirmed GS1's commitment but emphasized a gradual approach due to its 150+ member organizations.  
- **Patrick** raised concerns about GS1’s position on verifiable credentials, which **Steve** clarified, noting GS1's intention to implement the Digital Identity Anchor (DIA).  

#### **3. UNTP Information Architecture Update**  
- **Danika** presented an improved site structure for UNTP documentation.  
  - Focus on simplifying navigation and making content more user-friendly.  
  - Hierarchical model preferred over multidimensional structures to ease maintenance.  
  - Stakeholder-specific guides added to streamline access to relevant information.  
- **Patrick and Nick** supported the changes, emphasizing their clarity and usability.  

#### **4. UNTP Playground for Credential Validation**  
- **Ashley** demonstrated the latest features of the UNTP Playground, a tool for validating digital credentials.  
  - Now supports conformance testing with **VCDM v2**, JSON-LD validation, and schema checks.  
  - Users can generate downloadable **conformance reports** (eventually verifiable credentials).  
  - Planned features include public **credential repositories** for verified implementations.  
- **Patrick** suggested allowing direct downloads of **rendered HTML reports** from the Playground.  
- **Zach** proposed highlighting the **extension model** for bulk materials to demonstrate practical applications.  

#### **5. Discussion: Bulk Materials & Digital Material Passport**  
- **Steve** raised the question of whether bulk materials (e.g., grain, crude oil, copper concentrate) require a **Digital Material Passport** separate from the **Digital Product Passport**.  
- **Albertus, Nick, and Zach** argued that bulk materials should remain under **UNTP with extensions** rather than creating a new passport type.  
- **Ali Bezirizadeh** noted different traceability needs between **radioactive materials, iron ore, and concentrates** and asked whether classifications would be standardized.  
- **Peter** emphasized that **facility credentials** play a crucial role in bulk material traceability, not just the material itself.  
- **Adrian** (from a crude oil trading and chemical background) argued that **a material passport is necessary** because crude oil and intermediates differ from finished products.  
- **Steve** concluded that **real-world testing** should determine whether an extension is sufficient or if a new model is needed.  

#### **6. Closing Remarks**  
- **Steve** mentioned plans to create a **UNTP Media Page** listing external references to UNTP.  
- Next steps:  
  - Collect feedback on the **UNTP Playground** and **information architecture updates**.  
  - Continue practical tests for **bulk materials in UNTP** before deciding on a separate material passport.  
  - Publish the **media page** for community contributions.

## 2024-08-15 Meeting Summary

**Date**: August 14, 2024  
**Attendees**:  
- **Steve** (Speaker 1)  
- **Phil** (Speaker 2)  
- **Virginia** (Speaker 4)  
- **Zach** (Speaker 5)  
- **Patrick** (Speaker 3)  
- **Harley** (Speaker 13)  
- **Todd Taylor** (Speaker 7)  
- **Bree** (Speaker 8)

**Key Discussion Points**:

1. **Pull Request Review (Phil's Updates)**:
   - Phil discussed the simplification of terminology in the pull request. His changes primarily involved correcting typos and substituting GS1 references with corresponding ISO/IEC standards for event tracking and business vocabularies. This was done to align politically and avoid implying that GS1 identifiers are mandatory for using EPCIS.
   - Steve and others approved the pull request, agreeing to merge it as it was a simple update.

2. **ISO and UN Involvement in Global Digital Passport Standards**:
   - Steve mentioned an upcoming meeting at ISO to review a candidate project proposed by a Chinese standards authority to develop a global digital passport standard. He was invited to co-chair this initiative, potentially representing both the UN and ISO. The group discussed the significance of this project and the potential implications of having a UN co-chair involved.
   - Phil provided additional context, mentioning the Vienna Memorandum, an agreement between ISO and CEN-CENELEC to avoid duplication of efforts in standard development. He also noted GS1’s interest in participating in the project.

3. **New Digital Facility Record Proposal**:
   - Steve introduced the idea of adding a new credential type, a **Digital Facility Record (DFR)**, to the UN Transparency Protocol (UNTP). This record would focus on the facility itself rather than the product and could be used to track sustainability assessments at the facility level.
   - Virginia and Phil supported the idea, with Virginia suggesting the term "Facility Profile" to better represent the data. The group discussed how this could streamline sustainability reporting by making facilities first-order objects rather than secondary attributes of products.

4. **Challenges with Product Passport Updates**:
   - Zach raised concerns about updating digital product passports (DPPs) after they have been issued, such as adding post-sale repair events or certifications. The group acknowledged that while updates are crucial, there are challenges with ensuring that only authorized entities can modify the passport.
   - Steve proposed the idea of allowing certain events to be added to a product passport by authorized third parties, like certified repairers or recycling plants, using a delegated authority model.

5. **Formation of a Working Group**:
   - A new working group was formed, led by Zach, to explore solutions for managing updates to digital product passports. The group will work on defining the conditions under which updates can be made and will consider different approaches to identity resolution and authorization.

6. **Conformity Assessment Scheme Clarification**:
   - Bree raised a question regarding the linkage between conformity assessment schemes and regulations within the digital product passport framework. Steve clarified that in the context of product conformity, an assessment can reference multiple standards or regulations, bundled together in a scheme.
   - The group discussed how this framework might need to be adapted for regulatory permits and other credentials outside of product conformity.

**Action Items**:
- **Phil** and **Zach** to collaborate on a working group to explore digital product passport updates.
- **Steve** to create a proposal for the Digital Facility Record and present it for further review.
- **Bree** and **Patrick** to revisit the mapping of assessment schemes to regulations for conformity credentials and report back on potential updates to the framework.

**Conclusion**:
The meeting focused on refining standards around digital product passports, facility records, and conformity assessment schemes. The formation of a working group will drive further exploration of issues related to product passport updates and maintaining data integrity across complex supply chains.
