# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is UNTP free to use?

Yes, the UNTP intellectual property is owned by the United Nations and is provided free of charge for use by anyone. Furthermore, any party may modify the UNTP for their own purposes. However if you want to create a formal and registered UNTP extension then you must follow the [extension methodology and governance rules](../extensions/ExtensionsMethodology.md). 


## Can I issue a DPP for a product I haven't made yet? 

Yes, one can can issue batch/item DPP a short time in advance so long as there is confidence in the identifiers and the claims for that batch. One can issue a model DPP well in advance of any DPPs that are batch/ item specific.

## Can I add late arriving information? 

Eg I issued the DPP but then I just got my deforestation certificate and want to add a claim to already issued DPPs. This is a case of publishing an updated version that superseeds the previous version under the same model or batch/item ID. Here is an example: https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/specification/IdentityResolver#versioned-targets

## Can someone else add post-sale information to my DPP such as a repair event? 

In this case it's not an updated DPP because it's not the product manufacturer adding the late arriving data - instead it's the authorised repair facility or verified owner of the thing adding an event to the bundle of data about the thing. Here is how it might be approached https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/specification/DecentralisedAccessControl#decentralised-authentication-workflow
