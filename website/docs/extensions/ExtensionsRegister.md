### Universal Data Protocol for the Global Built Environment

* Extension Launched:  Nov-2024
* Release Date: TBA
* Industry: Built Environment (construction)
* Geography: Global

|Logo|Implementation Statement|
|--|--|
|![UDP](../../extensions/UDP/logo.jpg)|The Universal Data Protocol (UDP) is an extension of the UNTP and is seeking to leverage its decentralised framework to provide transparent, trustworthy, and verifiable data in the global built environment. The UDP is an open protocol that will allow for the efficient exchange of verifiable data, enhancing reporting and compliance across jurisdictions and life cycle stages. This project seeks to improve the interoperability of data across the built environment, aiming to make reporting more cost effective, accurate and efficient for all stakeholders. |
