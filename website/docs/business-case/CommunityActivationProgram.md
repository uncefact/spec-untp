# Introduction

The Community Activation Program (CAP) serves as a comprehensive framework and collaborative community designed to support industries in developing and implementing their own UNTP extension projects. Communities, supported by UNECE, continue to thrive long after the project is complete, aiding industries in adopting extensions and associated tools.

Recognizing the need for industry-wide collaboration to address challenges such as interoperability and costs, CAP offers structured solutions. Corporations often prefer not to act in isolation due to the risks and challenges associated with independent initiatives; CAP addresses this by fostering collective action, enabling industries to achieve shared goals through collaboration and mutual support. By leveraging a unified methodology, comprehensive toolkit, open-source software platforms, and globally recognized standards, CAP empowers industries to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and build trust among stakeholders, including regulators, financial institutions, and software vendors. This fosters deeper collaboration and shared benefits across sectors.

Through CAP, industries can assess the value of their extension projects and effectively engage diverse stakeholders to drive adoption.

Starting a UNTP project requires careful consideration of specific foundational elements that ensure the project’s alignment with industry needs and its potential for widespread adoption. These include:

* **Catalyst for adoption**: Identifying a clear and compelling driver for the project, such as new regulatory requirements (e.g., EUDR or Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism), or the need to align with a national or sectoral traceability strategy, provides focus and urgency for stakeholders.

* **Engaged buyers**: Buyers must perceive significant value in supplier data, such as enhanced product quality, compliance assurance, or risk mitigation. This engagement is essential to drive demand for the project outcomes.

* **Committed suppliers**: Suppliers must be willing and able to share critical data with buyers, especially when the project demonstrates a direct benefit to them, such as cost reductions, increased market access, or reputational gains.

* **Funding mechanism**: Robust and sustainable funding is crucial for supporting the project’s initial phases, covering development, outreach, and pilot testing. This ensures that the project gains traction and delivers early successes to build momentum.

# CAP delivers value to industries and creates a flywheel of adoption

Industry associations engaging with CAP to develop UNTP extensions benefit from:

* Shared costs and reduced financial risks for members.  
* Increased value proposition for association membership.  
* Enhanced trust and credibility within industries and stakeholders.  
* Accelerated momentum for product passports, trust services, and registries.  
* Alignment with emerging extensions, solving interoperability challenges.  
* Access to global experts, case studies, and robust tools.


As extension projects mature, they generate a self-sustaining flywheel effect. This mechanism drives innovation and growth by aligning stakeholders, fostering collaboration, and incentivizing continuous improvement. By enabling shared benefits, CAP ensures long-term progress and success.

# CAP supports a structured approach to extension development and adoption

The CAP toolkit offers a proven, six-phase methodology:

**Inception Phase**: This initial phase is centered on identifying key catalysts for change, such as emerging regulations, national traceability strategies, or industry-specific challenges. Stakeholders work collaboratively to build consensus, define project goals, and create a compelling business case that articulates value. Communities may already exist and catalyze around a pressing business problem, identifying UNTP as the most effective solution. At the end of this phase, a community may formally register their extension with UNTP, solidifying their commitment and alignment with global standards. Securing initial funding ensures the project is adequately resourced for success.

**Discovery Phase**: In this exploratory phase, current practices are systematically mapped to identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities. Stakeholders prioritize areas for improvement and establish clear objectives that align with industry needs and regulatory demands. This phase sets the foundation for a targeted and actionable implementation plan.

**Alpha Phase**: During the alpha phase, prototypes of the proposed systems and frameworks are developed and tested within controlled environments. This stage allows stakeholders to assess functionality, refine tools, and demonstrate tangible value to participants. Feedback loops are critical in ensuring the solution is robust and addresses real-world challenges effectively.

**Beta Phase**: Building on the alpha phase, the beta phase scales the project to a broader set of participants. Emphasis is placed on resolving interoperability challenges, ensuring compatibility with existing systems, and refining operational workflows. The project is tested in live scenarios to validate its scalability and effectiveness.

**Live Phase**: The final phase transitions the project into full-scale implementation. Stakeholders work to achieve widespread adoption, leveraging continuous improvement mechanisms to adapt to evolving industry needs. This phase ensures the extension remains sustainable, impactful, and aligned with broader industry objectives.
