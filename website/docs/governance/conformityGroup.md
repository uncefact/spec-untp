#### Technical discussion (ALL)
Focus on Sustainability Vocabulary as the major new work item. Some lack of clarity identified as to the nature and granularity of information in attestations that will be required to “unambiguously reference conformity criteria (from standards or regulations) they are based on, requiring each criterion to have a globally unique identifier”.  
Action 2: To translate this expectation into language actionable by CA professionals, initial scoping to be provided ahead of the August meeting by a volunteer group [Ulas, Gideon, Jeff, Brett]
