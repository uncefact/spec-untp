## Overview

Yet another greenwashing attack vector is to deliberately apply incorrect rules to the determination of criteria such as emissions intensity. The verification question in this case is "yes, but how do I know you calculated it right?". The UNTP proposes an independent calculator service offered either by the standards body or regulator that defined the rules or by an accredited service provider. The Supply chain actor presents raw data to the calculator which returns with a signed credential confirming that the rules were correctly applied. This protocol has an additional benefit for legitimate actors if widely adopted by rules authorities - which is to significantly simplify the assessment of compliance against multiple different rules. By separating observed facts from the assessment of those facts against specific rules then it becomes relatively simple to test compliance against multiple standards and regulations.
